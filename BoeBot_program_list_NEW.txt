BoeBot Programs listing:
1.1 – 1.4: THE BASICS  - Manipulating LEDs with basic code (OO Conversion: Max):
-	Turn on an LED 
-	Blink an LED 
-	Cycle LEDs 
-	Dim an LED using a for loop

2.1 – 2.2: THE BASICS – Manipulating LEDs and reading sensors (OO Conversion: Errica):
- 	Toggle an LED using the button
- 	Dim an LED using the potentiometer

3.1 – 3.4 THE BASICS, Part 3 – Manipulating the Servo motors with basic code (OO Conversion: Julia):
-	Drive the robot a direction for x seconds 
-	Drive the robot a direction for x seconds, then back y seconds 
-	Toggle the Servos using the button
-	Control the speed of the robot using a potentiometer, and change the led based on robot speed.

4.1 – 4.2 MODERATE Programs – Using more sensors, and more complex functions (OO Conversion: Kyle):
-	Drive the robot until the ultrasonic sees a wall 
-	While drive the robot, display an led and have and speaker beep when the robot sees a wall 
	KYLE - feel free to change/modify these if you find they don't work well with the ultrasonics.  

5.1 – 5.4 DIFFICULT Programs – Utilize the line following sensors and do more complex tasks with the ultrasonic (OO Conversion: Nick):
-	5.0 - calibration program - use this to determine your boebot's white and black line values first
-	Have the robot drive forward until it detects a change in values 
-	Have the robot follow a line using the line following sensors
-	Have the robot follow a line using the line following sensors and calibrate itself (To Be added: have the LED's turn on/off when robot sees line. ex. red led turns on when robot is turning left).


6.1 FINAL CHALLENGE Programs – Using multiple sensors and what has been learned in the previous lessons, application of knowledge for complex tasks
