/*Software 1073 Arduino BoeBots
User Program 
Method stubs are pre-made. add your own code to complete the challenge!

Program Task: Using both the line sensors, follow a line AND:
1) auto-calibrate (so that the user does not have to change the code)
2) be able to continue moving when both line sensors see a black line

Feel free to view the example program within the same folder if you need help!
